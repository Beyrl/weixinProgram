# weixinProgram

This is a program that apply wechat mini program technology.    
It has three parts : ***components api and tip***. 

## components   
components include wechat mini program's（here in after referred to as wxMini）commonly used components. These commonly used components all
have their own cases. Through these little cases ,you can know these components's application effect.

## api  
api include wechat wxMini's commonly used api.Just like components ,you can also know these api's application effect through little cases.And
meanwhile,at the api section , i designed a very useful function（at least i think it's very helpful),is an indexing function,you can find the
api you want through it's initial.Of course ,you have to know at least the first word of the api...hahhhh. But there is one thing i have to say,
there is a little bug in the indexing function,emmm,but i will fixing it as soon as possible.

## tip
I love this part best! This part can tell you what you should do and what not. And it list many holes i steped before. I think this part can help you lot!

## Novice tips   
I think this weixinProgram is very useful for the new one who want to quickly start wxMini.But when you wang to use this programe ,you have to read
the wxMini's doc. All of them. It can help you to understand wxMini.
